# xbeach-mi

XBeach MI (Multiple Instances) is a Python wrapper for XBeach that allows the user to run multiple instances of XBeach simultaneously. Each instance can have its own settings. Possible applications are:

- Running XBeach in stationairy and instationairy mode alternating depending on the wave conditions
- Running XBeach with multiple wind conditions and averaging the result (MORMERGE)

A BMI-compatible version of XBeach is needed to use with the XBeach MI Python wrapper. The wrapper itself is also BMI compatible.
